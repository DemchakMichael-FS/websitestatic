# Static Website

A basic website built with Next.js for my class project.

## Setup

You need Node.js to run this project.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site runs at http://localhost:5876

## Build

```
npm run build
```

This creates static files in the `build_new` folder.

## Notes

- Made with Next.js
- Uses Tailwind for styling
- Configured for static export
